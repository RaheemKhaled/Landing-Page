# Landing-Page
In this project I make links are same as tabs for landing page website:
  - section 1 is linked to a section 1 in the website
  - section 2 is linked to a section 2 in the website
  - section 3 is linked to a section 3 in the website
  - section 4 is linked to a section 4 in the website
  - Home is linked to the top of the website
That is by adding event to links which make it scroll dynamically

And using the getBoundRect() method to know the top of all sections by looping on it by for ,and add to section a class of 'your-active-class' , and removing this class from other sections
